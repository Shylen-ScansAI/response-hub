There are guidelines in the app (green borders) while doing the inspection, on how to capture the photos as accurately as possible. Please note, photos of the exterior, interior, license disc, VIN plate and Odometer will be required.\n\nPlease try follow the green guidelines within the app as closely as possible, as well as ensuring your photos are clear and the car is visible, to avoid your inspection being rejected.`,
